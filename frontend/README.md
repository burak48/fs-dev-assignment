- `react-dom`: a package that provides DOM-specific methods that can be used at the top level of a web application to enable interaction with a web page.
- `fetch`: a native API for making asynchronous HTTP requests in the browser.
- `tailwindcss`: a utility-first CSS framework that provides a set of pre-defined classes to help you style your application quickly and easily.
